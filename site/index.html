    <h1>London</h1>
    <p>London is the capital city of England. It is the most populous city in the  United Kingdom, with a metropolitan area of over 13 million inhabitants.</p>
    <p>Standing on the River Thames, London has been a major settlement for two millennia, its history going back to its founding by the Romans, who named it Londinium.</p>
    <p>London is the capital and largest city of England and the United Kingdom.[7][8] Standing on the
        River Thames in the south-east of England, at the head of its 50-mile (80 km) estuary leading to the North Sea, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. Londinium was founded by the Romans.[9] The City of London, London's ancient core − an area of just 1.12 square miles (2.9 km2) and colloquially known as the Square Mile − retains boundaries that closely follow its medieval limits.[10][11][12][13][14][note 1] The City of Westminster is also an Inner London borough holding city 
        status. London is governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly.[15][note 2][16]</p>
